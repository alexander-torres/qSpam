# qSpam
Small add-on for Universal Paperclips game that spams Quantum Computing when qOps is positive. It produces a small, draggable window with a toggle button that starts and stops the spamming code.

So far, this code is written to be copied and pasted into the developer console while playing the game. Not sure yet how to make it easier to implement, so I'm open to ideas.

I'm still considering adding other features. The goal is to automate parts of the game or give the player more precise control without replacing built-in, unlockable features from the game. Automation should be limited to optimizing user input and not change how the game itself runs. I don't want to make the game so easy that it's no longer fun.

Future features may include:
- Adding a single button for generating a new strategy engine tournament and then running it. This would replace having to click two separate buttons and move your mouse back and forth to generate Yomi, which gets annoying after a dozen or so runs, thereby making generating Yomi a lot faster and easier.
- Auto deposit or withdraw money from Investment Engine at specified amounts. Makes it much easier for players to withdraw funds when they get cashed out of stocks for a split second.
- Small alerts for when the cost of wire drops below a specified amount. Also avoiding automating wire purchasing at lower price since this conflicts with an already unlockable part of the game.
- !SPOILER ALERT! Adding toggles that can quickly add and remove a trust point from one of the Von Neumann Probe categories, when it can be afforded. This allows for more precise control when building additional drones/factories to help the player balance harvesting/wire/factory production rates.
- Any other ideas?

Is this useless or over-powered? Let me know!
